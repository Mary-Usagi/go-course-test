    "Name": "Marie Curie",
    "Title": "Physicist and Chemist",
    "About": "Marie Curie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and the first person to ever win it twice. She discovered the chemical elements radium and polonium, and pioneered research in radioactivity. She also developed mobile X-ray units for medical use during World War I.",
    "Projects": [
        {
            "Title": "Isolation of Polonium and Radium",
            "Description": "Marie Curie and her husband Pierre Curie isolated two new radioactive elements from pitchblende, a mineral containing uranium. They named them polonium, after Marie's native country Poland, and radium, after the Latin word for ray. They also measured the atomic mass of radium and determined its place in the periodic table.",

            "Title": "Radioactivity of Thorium",
            "Description": "Marie Curie discovered that thorium, another element, also emitted radiation. She coined the term radioactivity to describe this phenomenon, and showed that it was a property of the atom, not a chemical reaction. She also developed methods to measure the intensity of radiation using an electrometer.",

            "Title": "Mobile X-ray Units",
            "Description": "Marie Curie recognized the potential of X-rays for medical diagnosis and treatment, especially during wartime. She organized the installation of X-ray equipment in cars and trucks, which she called petites Curies, or little Curies. She also trained nurses and doctors on how to use them safely and effectively.",
